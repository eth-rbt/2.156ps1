# Problem 6 Merging Process

## Overview
This process merges Problem 6 (Curve 6) mechanisms from two sources:
1. **Overnight run results**: `/Users/ethrbt/code/2.156/2155-Optimization-Challenge-Problem/overnight_run_20250929_204331/submission.npy`
2. **Optimized curve 6**: `/Users/ethrbt/code/2.156/2155-Optimization-Challenge-Problem/optimized_curve_6.npy`

## Data Summary
- **Overnight Problem 6**: 250 mechanisms
- **Optimized Problem 6**: 111 mechanisms
- **Combined total**: 361 mechanisms

## Process Steps

### 1. Data Examination (`examine_curve6.py`)
- ✅ **Completed** - Analyzes structure of both datasets
- Shows that optimized file contains mechanisms for all problems, not just Problem 6

### 2. Proper Merging (`merge_curve6_proper.py`)
- ✅ **Completed** - Extracts only Problem 6 mechanisms from both sources
- Creates `submission_merged_problem6_only.npy` with 361 mechanisms for Problem 6
- Creates `problem6_merged_mechanisms.npy` for analysis

### 3. Pareto Extraction with Simulation (`extract_pareto_problem6.py`)
- ✅ **Completed** - Demonstrates Pareto extraction process with simulated F values
- Creates `submission_final_pareto_problem6.npy` (demo only)
- Shows: 361 → 91 feasible → 4 Pareto mechanisms

### 4. Actual LINKS Evaluation (`merge_problem6_with_evaluation.py`)
- ⏳ **Ready to run** - Requires JAX/LINKS environment
- Will evaluate all 361 mechanisms using actual LINKS Tools
- Will extract true Pareto frontier based on real performance
- Will create final optimized submission

## Files Created

### Intermediate Files
- `submission_merged_problem6_only.npy` - Overnight submission with 361 Problem 6 mechanisms
- `problem6_merged_mechanisms.npy` - Just the 361 combined mechanisms

### Demo Files (Simulated)
- `submission_final_pareto_problem6.npy` - Demo with simulated evaluation
- `problem6_pareto_mechanisms.npy` - Demo Pareto mechanisms
- `problem6_pareto_f_values.npy` - Demo F values

### Final Files (After Real Evaluation)
- `submission_final_merged_problem6.npy` - **FINAL SUBMISSION**
- `problem6_final_pareto_mechanisms.npy` - Final Pareto mechanisms
- `problem6_final_pareto_f_values.npy` - Real F values
- `problem6_merge_evaluation_comparison.png` - Comparison plot

## To Complete the Process

**Run in JAX/LINKS environment:**
```bash
python merge_problem6_with_evaluation.py
```

This will:
1. Load both datasets (250 + 111 mechanisms)
2. Evaluate all 361 mechanisms using LINKS Tools
3. Extract the true Pareto frontier from combined data
4. Create the final optimized submission file
5. Generate comparison plots

## Expected Outcome
- ✅ Improved hypervolume for Problem 6
- ✅ Best mechanisms from both optimization runs
- ✅ True Pareto frontier based on actual evaluation
- ✅ Final submission ready for competition

## Next Steps
1. Run `merge_problem6_with_evaluation.py` in proper environment
2. Verify the final submission quality
3. Use `submission_final_merged_problem6.npy` as the competition submission
